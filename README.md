- 👋 Hi, I’m @eyetengu
- 👀 I’m interested in ... making things with Arduino, working in my yard and building web stores.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... with Freemote
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... projects that make life easier while maintaining individual privacy and personal rights and liberties.
- 📫 How to reach me ... text or email but I am not yet ready to share that info.

UNABLE TO DO THE HELLO-WORLD TUTORIAL 
Oh, and no easy way to get help.
This sucks!
